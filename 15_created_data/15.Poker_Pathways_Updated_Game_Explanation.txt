Title: Poker Pathways

Materials:
- 3 dice
- A3 paper for board
- 12 playing pieces (4 colors, 3 pieces per player)
- One set of poker cards (54 cards, including two jokers)

Setup:
1. Draw a 6x6 grid on the A3 paper to create a 36 square board.
2. Shuffle the set of poker cards and deal 5 cards to each player.
3. Place the remaining deck of cards facedown, leaving room for a discard pile beside it.
4. Each player selects a color and places their 3 playing pieces at their respective starting corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).

Gameplay Rules:
1. The initial player rolls the 3 dice and moves one of their pieces based on the numbers rolled. For each number, move horizontally or vertically along the grid.
2. Players must choose which dice go with each move (e.g. if you roll a 3, 4, and 5, you could move one piece 3 spaces, another 4 spaces, and the same or another piece 5 spaces).
3. After moving, the player may play a card from their hand on the table in front of them to perform a specific action:
   - Number cards (2-10): move an opponent's piece that number of spaces in any direction.
   - Face cards: grant special abilities (Jack: swap positions of any two pieces, Queen: move any piece diagonally, King: block an opponent's next move)
   - Ace: move any piece to any unoccupied square.
   - Joker: act as a wildcard, substituting for any card above.
4. Cards played are placed in the discard pile, and the player draws a new card to maintain a 5-card hand.
5. Proceed clockwise around the table.

Game Ending Conditions:
1. The game ends when a player has successfully moved all three of their pieces to their respective opposite corner (e.g. top-left to bottom-right). The first player to achieve this wins.
2. If the deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to create a new deck and continue playing until a winner is determined.
