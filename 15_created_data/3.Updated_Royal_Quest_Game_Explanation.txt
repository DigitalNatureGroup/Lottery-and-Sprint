Title: Royal Quest - The Poker Strategy Board Game

Materials:
1. 3 dice (6-sided)
2. Durable laminated A3 board with a specified layout (spaces, walls, rooms, and gardens)
3. 12 game pieces (3 for each player)
4. One set of poker cards (54 cards including two jokers)

Setup:
1. Place the A3 board in the center of the table.
2. Each player selects their color and places their 3 game pieces in their starting positions on the board.
3. Shuffle the poker card deck and place it facedown, leaving space for a discard pile.
4. Players roll a die to determine the starting player (highest roll goes first).

Gameplay Rules:
1. On their turn, each player rolls 3 dice and makes a move based on their roll results, with the option to move either one, two, or all of their game pieces.
2. Players draw two cards at the beginning of their turn and may discard one card if they wish.
3. The objective is to form a strong competitive poker hand (at least a full house) by collecting cards and capturing other players' pieces.
4. Players can capture an opponent's piece by landing on the same space, but it must be done strategically as the capturer must show a higher hand to succeed.
5. Once a piece is captured, the opponent must discard any cards associated with that piece (losing a portion of their poker hand).
6. Players collect special power-ups in certain board spaces to enhance their abilities or affect opponents' game progress.

Game Ending Conditions:
1. The game ends when one player manages to successfully capture all their opponents' game pieces.
2. If players are unable to capture all the game pieces, the game ends once the poker card deck is used up. In this scenario, the player with the strongest poker hand wins.

Board Layout and Design:
The laminated A3 board is divided into a grid pattern, featuring clearly separated spaces, walls that block movement, rooms with power-ups, and garden spaces that provide bonuses to the players.

Unique Point:
Royal Quest combines elements of poker hands and impassioned strategic board game movement, providing a novel experience for players who enjoy both card games and board games.

Enjoyable Point:
The game allows for exciting moments of sudden victories and crushing losses. It keeps players engaged and entertained as they weigh capturing moves wisely, plan their strategies and navigate through potential comebacks.

Strategy to Win the Game:
To win Royal Quest, players must adopt a multi-faceted approach, balancing offense in capturing other players' pieces and creating a strong poker hand, and defense in protecting their own pieces from opponents while adapting to the board's limitations and opportunities.

With the revised Royal Quest game, players can enjoy an improved gaming experience that encourages strategic thinking, poker knowledge, and engaging interactions. The updated layout and enhanced quality materials will ensure better gameplay and longevity.
