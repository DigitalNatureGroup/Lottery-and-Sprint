Materials:
1. 3 dice
2. A3 laminated paper or cardboard for the board
3. 12 pieces (4 differently colored sets of 3)
4. One set of poker cards (54 cards including 4 suits and 2 jokers)

Setup:
1. Draw a racing track on the A3 laminated paper or cardboard with a start and finish line, suitable for a 30-minute gameplay (approximately 50 spaces).
2. Each player chooses a set of pieces (3 pieces per player) and places them at the starting line.
3. Shuffle the poker cards and deal 4 cards to each player.

Gameplay Rules:
1. The game is played in turns, with each player rolling 2 dice during their turn.
2. The player can use the sum of the dice to move any of their pieces forward that many spaces.
3. After moving, the player can choose to play one of their poker cards. Cards affect the gameplay as follows:
   - Number cards (2-10): Move an opponent's piece backward that many spaces.
   - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): Move any of your pieces forward the corresponding spaces (Jack - 11, Queen - 12, King - 13).
   - Ace: Players swap the position of one of their pieces with an opponent's piece.
   - Joker: The player can choose to move any of their pieces backward or forward up to 8 spaces, or choose an opponent's piece to move backward up to 8 spaces.
